- Anything more than 61 keys is BLOAT
- RK61 has broken /? keys and there is no way of fixing it in Linux
- CK61 and DK61 has no Linux software that comes with it in GitHub
- dunno about Ajazz and Maibenben 61 key keyboards tho
- anything over 50USD (in 2016~2020 dollars) are overpriced
- Anne Pro 2 (expensive)

- Nothing on SK61 or Feker or iQuinx F60 (expensive)
